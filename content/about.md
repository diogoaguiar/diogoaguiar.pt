## The Short Version

A software engineer with over 10 years in software development and more than 15 years in the broader tech field. Passionate about using technology as a tool for business impact. Not just writing code, but solving problems that matter.

## How I Work

I get involved early and stay close to the problem. That means understanding the business context, mapping out opportunities, and working alongside teams to shape the right solution. From first concept to production, I bring both strategic thinking and hands-on execution.

## What Drives Me

Building things that create real value. I believe the best technology solutions come from deeply understanding the problem, not from jumping straight to code. Every engagement is an opportunity to help a business move forward.
